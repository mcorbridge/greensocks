	<div class="infoText">What is so great about <b>Bower</b>? For the uninitiated, Bower is a package manager, and it is very good at, well, managing packages.
		All those things that you depend on an external author for. Good examples are CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, libraries like jQuery, jQuery plugins,
		or JavaScript frameworks like Angular.  Because web sites are made of lots of things, like frameworks, libraries, assets, and utilities.
		Bower manages all these things for you. Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding,
		downloading, and saving the stuff youâ€™re looking for.  Is it worth learning yet another set of command in a brain already crammed with
		Git, Node and Gulp?  The answer is a definitive <b>YES</b>.  Plus the Bower bird icon is a nice splash of color?  Dontcha think?</div>
